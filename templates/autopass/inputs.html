    <p>
      Let's try something a bit more interesting.
    </p>
    <form>
      <input type="text" name="pass" pattern="{{ passphrase }}"/>
      <input type="submit"/>
    </form>
    <p>
      <!-- Psst! this is the wrong place to look! try looking in the <input> elements in the actual <form>! which one is the text field? -->
      This time, the form won't accept the wrong password at all. (Try submitting some gibberish!)<br/>
      This is done through the <b>pattern</b> attribute in the text input. It says: <code>pattern="[whatever the correct password is]"</code> 
      <br/>Find it, and you will know the password!
